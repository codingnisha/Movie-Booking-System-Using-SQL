# Movie-Booking-System
Project is to create a centralised movie booking system to ease the movie booking task.
This system will help the customer to find relevant information for booking seats in a theatre from anywhere and the admin to keep track of the bookings.
The system will hold information about the theatres, movies, customers and bookings.
The system will help customers to be updated with the upcoming movies.
The system will also help the workers of the theatres to work more efficiently.
